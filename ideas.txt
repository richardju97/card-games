DATA TO PLOT:

currently done:
- dealer's first card (faced up) vs. number of busts/no busts
- player's start hand vs. player busts/no busts
- player's final stay vs. whether or not they win (graph groups by number of win/lose/tie)

big picture:
- have all data in one table so graph creation is customizable

- user inputs: type of bot
- output: csv file with stats in data/results folder
